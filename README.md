## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com)

### What I learned

I learnt to use blockquote and q for the first time instead of using directed quotes for the advices. 
I also introduced the use of a spinner to display while a quote loads.

```html
<blockquote class="quote-text">
  <q>
    <span id="quote"></span>
  </q>
</blockquote>
```
